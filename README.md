# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles managed with the help of rake tasks.


## Features

  * oh-my-zsh for managing zsh config files
  * spf13-vim for managing vim config
  * Every config file/folder gets linked to its place in the system. No copy of files.
  * Clear structure of config files: every application has its their own folder
  * Support for macOS and Linux (Ubuntu)


## Installation

Make sure installed ruby and rake.

### Initial setup
